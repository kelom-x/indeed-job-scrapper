# indeed-job-scrapper


This is a simple python script to scrape jobs from indeed.com, 

using a scheduler (eg. cron job ), you can schedule this script to be sending the jobs to your mail periodically


before using this script, make the necessary changes in the job_email_settings.txt


Obviously, a number of improvements  can be made to this program, such as: 
- ecrypting the config settings in the job_email_settings.txt
- modifying to sending the email to multiple recepient
- not to send any mail when no job record is retreived 

etc.
